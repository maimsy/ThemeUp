The Nokia Music Windows Phone API lets you easily integrate your Windows Phone application with Nokia Music on Nokia Lumia phones.
The API offers two levels of integration; the simplest and quickest to get going is to use the high-level Launcher Tasks,
with more advanced integration available to perform searches and get recommendations within your app.
